# STUDENT-DBMS
A code to help a person keep track of details about students of an instituition.



To be honest, i didnt write the whole code on my own. I took some modular approach to the whole project and seeked help from other projects to get my required codes. Improvised the code to fit all edge situations. It works fine with any c++ compiler.

Someday will get my program which will be as a whole mine. Working on DBMS now.

**SECRET: The password is "pass"**.


HAPPY CODING.
